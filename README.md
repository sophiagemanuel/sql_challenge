# sql_challenge
## Introduction
The SQL Challenge involves creating a database schema from CSV files, generating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and performing various SQL queries to analyze the data. The project focuses on employee data, including departments, managers, salaries, and titles.

## Features
Database schema creation from CSV files
ERD generation using QuickDBD
SQL data analysis queries
Detailed documentation of SQL queries and their results

## ERD Diagram
The ERD for this project was created using QuickDBD and is saved as QuickDBD-export.png. It includes the following tables:
Dept_Emp
Departments
Dept_manager
Employees
Salaries
Titles

## SQL Queries

Module 9 Challenge:
To begin the Module 9 Challenge, I first put the CSV files within the Module 9 Starter File into the 'resources' file. I then opened each of the files and created tables for each file using the Quick DBD website (https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).
I created my ERD based off the CSV files, creating the entity boxes of Dept_Emp, Departments, Dept_manager, Employees, Salaries, and Titles. Within those I gave primary keys to 'dept_no' within Departments, 'emp_no' within Employees, and 'title_id' within Titles. My ERD can be found within the Employee SQL titled 'QuickDBD-export.png' and the code that was exported into PostGreSQL under the name 'table-creation.sql'
My data analysis is found within EmployeeSQL, within the Data Analysis folder.
For each question, there is a corresponding sql file:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
